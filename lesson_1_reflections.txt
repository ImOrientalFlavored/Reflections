How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

	It shows where in the code two versions of a file had differences
	making it much more convenient to debug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	Its well organized and in chronological order. Easy to access and search.

As a programmer, when would you want to have a version of your code saved?

	When I've made significant and well tested changes.
	When the session has ended. 	

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	Manual saving gives you the freedom when you want to save. Unlike google docs or dropbox which may save over an interval of time during at random instance of the work flow, you can choose when a save seems most logical. Although manually saving does carry the risk of human error.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	
	Not sure.

	One reason may come down to Git and Google Docs serve different purposes, where Git is intended to be used for programming projects and Google docs is a general use case.

	Possibly Google docs prefers a difference in philosphy.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	
	Git log allows you to see the history of commits. From recent to oldest.
	Git diff of the former followed by the later shows the changes between the commits

	A shortcut to quickly see the number of changes is using Git log with --Stat option

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	Git allows you to revert to an older commit that may be more stable.
	Git also allows you to branch your commits giving you more flexibility to make experimental changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	Maybe I'll know on the next commit hehe
